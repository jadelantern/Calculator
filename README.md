# Calculator
Basic Calculator App

This project was used as a test to test my current skills without the use of Google or other assistance.

## Expectations
Before starting this project I had these expectations:

• Get a better understand of how a calculator works under the hood.

• I expected this project to be very difficult as I have never tried to make a project like this previously.

• I had never worked with a method that was passing information and proccessed mathmatical calculations.

• I was not sure how I would end up organizing all the code.

## Addressing Expectations

Upon creation of this project, I learned:

• This was MUCH easier than I thought It was.

• Before starting this project, I was overthinking it way too much.

• I reached a point where I was repeating a lot of code.  That was the point where I realized this is the time to create a method. This was very helpful in allowing me to see when I should create a method.  

• I created a class that had a method for each kind of calculation (Addition, Subtraction, etc). Organizing the methods in this class helped me with figuring out better ways to format my code.
